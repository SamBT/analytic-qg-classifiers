kernelOrder = -1 : Only do gluon emission, and with purely eikonal splitting kernel (e.g. P_{q->qg} = 2/(1-z)). No g->qq in ISR or FSR. No CMW
kernelOrder = 0: Do LO gluon emission and g->qq~, including soft and collinear terms, no CMW
kernelOrder = 1:  Do LO gluon emission and g->qq~, including soft and collinear terms, with "CMW" for soft pieces
kernelOrder = 2:  Do LO gluon emission and g->qq~, including soft and collinear terms, with CMW including three-loop pieces for soft pieces
kernelOrder = 3:  Do gluon emission and g->qq~, including soft and collinear terms, with CMW including three-loop for soft pieces, and NLO DGLAP as NLO corrections in collinear terms.
